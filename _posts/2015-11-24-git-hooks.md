Recently I moved my Jekyl blog to a shared web server with a ssh access.
It was the open door for me to use a git through ssh and so use it to deploy my blog.

But I had a problem when creating my post-receive hook.
I was performing a git fetch and a git checkout through my script but I was having a error code 128.

To investigate a little bit more I began to log each command by redirecting outpout with mycommand &> mylog.txt.

The exact message was: fatal: Not a git repository: '.'

And I discovered that a shell variable GIT_DIR was set to . instead of .git. Each time I cding to my cloned git dir to perform my fetch and checkout it was expecting a git dir ".".

So I edited my shell script and set the correct GIT_DIR variable like the following:

{% highlight sh %}
# GIT_DIR is . by default, we overwrite it.
GIT_DIR=.git
cd ~/gitwork/myblog
#set &>> ~/log.txt
git fetch &>> ~/log.txt
#echo Fetching $? >> ~/log.txt
git checkout origin/master &>> ~/log.txt
#echo Checkouting $? >> ~/log.txt
cp -R _site/* ~/www/myblog
#echo "fin" >> ~/log.txt
{% endhighlight %}
