<p>Solr is hosted by the well known Heroku: https://addons.heroku.com/websolr</p>
<p>So for my architecture it would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crawling on a private home made server with Nutch</li>
<li>Pushing data to solr</li>
<li>Building an hosted PHP site OR using Heroku to deploy a simple search front end (to be studied).</li>
</ul>
