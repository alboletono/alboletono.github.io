<p>When trying to use the very good site http://www.grooveshark.com I had an issue with my flash player on iceweasel. I couldn't hear any music!</p>
<p>So what to do is:<br />
- update flash player: sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree<br />
- double check your flash player version on line (should be in line with new one): http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/</p>
