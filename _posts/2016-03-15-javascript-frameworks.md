Tested on my side:
- angularJS: at version 1, now deprecated...
- ReactJS: currently tested. JSX to be learnt.

Development tools:
- WebStorm (commercial licence)
- brackets
- sublime



I've tried with sublime text but as far as the 3 version is beta, I didn't succeeded into setting it:

- Sublime text 3
- plugin Package Control
- plugin Babel (through Package Control: Ctrl + Shift + P / Install package)

But for me, it is better using directly atom with react plugin (more user friendly)

The web storm, even if commercial (few euros per month), looks like an interesting investment for bigger projects.
