Google let us not to bother about the solutions. That's great.

But as far as I've got some brains I'll use someting else. I'm not smarter but I just want to control data I'm storing.

Here I'm quickly describing softwares I'm using to store my music, videos, contacts, calendars and else.

In fact nothing really hard you only have to choose the right solution. So will you have to try some softwares to have a clear picture by your own.

Step 1: Setup your private cloud
---

* Find a good web hosting:
    * For me: [ovh-hosting]
* Install the owncloud server [owncloud-install]:
    * For me : owncloud 8.2

Step 2: Activating owncloud plugins
---

I've activated three useful plugins in owncloud:
* Calendar: in order to sync all my appointments
* Contacts: to manage my contacts (email, addresses, phone numbers, etc...)
* Bookmarks: to manage my web bookmarks (instead of my d.e.l.i.c.i.o.u.s. contacts)

Step 3: Setting up my Desktop computer
---

I've installed the desktop application to sync my business data and personal data with two distinct accounts: [owncloud-desktop-clients].


Step 4 : Setting up my mobile devices
---

I got a tablet (Google Nexus 7, yes, google too :)) and a smartphone (Sony Xperia Aqua M4).

For my contacts, I'm using CardDav Sync Free: [carddav].
You can still use your favorite contacts app because this is a connector.
