<p>Here is the practical case: crawling a cooking site (marmiton.org).</p>
<p>Initially, I made the mistake of copy/pasting parser-html (yes, yes!) and update it according to my needs.</p>
<p>There is a better way (of course ;)). By exploring the code I noticed that there was a HtmlParseFilter interface! I've observed the "parse-js" code and see that it is doing something like I would.</p>
<p>So I've duplicated the code of parse-js and adapt it to fit my needs. I could have used directly regexes instead of node walkers but no matter for my exercise it is working.</p>
<p>I've added some JUnit tests to avoid deploying each time my extension to nutch and "voil√†!", it is working!</p>
<p>Do not forget to reference your new parser into your nuch-site.conf (in plugin-includes section).</p>
